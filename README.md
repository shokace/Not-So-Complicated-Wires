Ok, so we all know the complicated wires part in the game is... complicated. 

So I made it easier... Instead of using a printout of the instructions for the game (necessary without this tool), you can instead just go through the GUI and go through regular questions, with all the logic already programmed. No more confusion!

By the way, all of this is written with Qt5. Compiled with MinGW32. Good luck, happy gaming. :D
