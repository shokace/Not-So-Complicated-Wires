# Not-So-Complicated-Wires
Keep Talking And Nobody Explodes Tool

Ok, so we all know complicated wires are... complicated. 

So I made it easier... maybe harder? BUT NOW IT'S A GUI.

The scenario:

Friend1: Omg! Complicated wires, get out your confusing paper!
Friend2: Njet, I use program created by bored programmer overseas
Friend1: Perfect, we finish in record time! 

Be more like Friend1 and Friend2 and use my beautiful program, and maybe make it better if you'd like?
